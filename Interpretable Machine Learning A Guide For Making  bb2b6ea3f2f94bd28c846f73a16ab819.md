# Interpretable Machine Learning: A Guide For Making Black Box


# Different types of interpretability

### Global vs. Local Interpretability

- Global interpretability refers to the ability to understand how a model makes decisions across its entire input space.
- Local interpretability refers to the ability to understand how a model makes decisions for a specific input or set of inputs.

### Model-Specific vs. Model-Agnostic Interpretability

- Model-specific interpretability refers to the ability to interpret a specific type of model, such as a decision tree or a neural network.
- Model-agnostic interpretability refers to the ability to interpret any type of model, regardless of its specific structure or complexity.

### Functional vs. Post-hoc Interpretability:

- Functional interpretability refers to the ability to interpret a model based on its underlying mathematical or statistical functions.
- Post-hoc interpretability refers to the ability to interpret a model based on its input-output relationship, without necessarily understanding the underlying mathematical or statistical functions.

# Model-Specific Methods

- Decision trees: interpreting decision trees using tree plots, variable importance measures, and example-based explanations.
- Linear models: interpreting linear models using coefficient values, standard errors, and hypothesis tests.
- Support vector machines: interpreting support vector machines using support vectors and decision boundaries.

# Model-Agnostic Methods

- Partial Dependence Plots: visualizing the relationship between a feature and the model output while holding all other features constant.
- Individual Conditional Expectation: visualizing how the model output changes with a specific feature value while holding all other features constant.
- Permutation Feature Importance: measuring the importance of a feature by randomly permuting its values and observing the effect on the model output.

# Evaluation of Interpretability

- Intrinsic evaluation: evaluating the interpretability of a model based on its structure and complexity.
- Extrinsic evaluation: evaluating the interpretability of a model based on its performance in a specific task.
- User evaluation: evaluating the interpretability of a model based on feedback from users.

# Applications of Interpretability

- Fraud detection: using interpretable models to identify fraudulent transactions.
- Medical diagnosis: using interpretable models to make accurate and explainable medical diagnoses.
- Image recognition: using interpretable models to classify images and generate explanations for the classification decisions.

# Challenges and Future Directions

- The need for more research on interpretability in deep learning models, which are often difficult to interpret.
- The ethical considerations surrounding the use of interpretable machine learning, such as ensuring that the model is fair and unbiased.
